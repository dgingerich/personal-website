# Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website. A live version can be found at dannygingerich.com.

The website is written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It runs off of a very basic Node.js/Express server (located at app.js).

It is a single page website, but has multiple sections that would normally be separate pages. Because I don't have a huge amount of content, I thought the simplicity of a single page website suited it best. 

The JavaScript code is used to allow hyperlinks to travel to different anchor points on the page. It also changes the underlined section on the header based on the section you are looking at.

The website should be optimized for most relatively new mobile devices.
